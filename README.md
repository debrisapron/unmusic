# *UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

# unmusic

unmusic (um) is an electron app, web app & JS library for composing & live-coding music.

## Example

```
// Plays a repeating four-note piano sequence
um.play(sf.acousticGrandPiano('C E G F'))
```

## Rationale

I want to

- Use a "real" language rather than a specialized music language.
- Describe music declaratively in terms of compositional units like notes and parts, not software constructs like clocks and events.
- Move seamlessly between the macro level (musical structure) and the micro level (individual notes/sounds).
- Use a workflow which provides rapid feedback (live coding).
- Integrate and build on the best work of the Web Audio API development community.
- Use a modern, functional JavaScript style that emphasizes the strengths of ES201x & ditches pointless complexity like prototypal inheritance & `this`.

More information & API reference can be found in the `docs` folder.
