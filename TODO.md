- Replace um.part with um.assign, a function which applies middlewares to the signal chain
  - All middlewares are a single function
  - Signature is (action, deps, next)
  - If called with no args, returns deps, id & clock, which are cached using id as key
  - Processors (event fx) are applied to the action before calling next with the new action
  - Audio fx are applied by connecting the returned node to an fx node & returning the fx node
  - Convert existing destinations to middlewares
- Add new um.proc namespace for processors
  - Arpeggiator
  - Delay
  - Transpose
- Alternate names: um.apply, um.arrange, um.arr
